## Scafall
> Previously **WolfyUtils**
 
Scaffolding aims to be a source of APIs and Utils to assist in the creation of multi-platform Minecraft Plugins/Mods.
The initial goal is to provide APIs that provide access to the most used parts of each platform,  
which include for example: Tasks & Scheduling, Adventure Wrappers for common Audiences, ItemStacks, and more.

### Still in WIP (Alpha)
This project is very much still in early alpha!   
**The API may receive breaking changes at anytime without notice!**

### Additional Modules/Libraries
The goal of this project is to really just provide the basic scaffolding and assist in the development process.  
Additional Modules/Libraries may extend upon this API and provide more sophisticated APIs and Utils.  
* [viewportl](https://github.com/WolfyScript/viewportl) - A Minecraft Inventory GUI framework, designed to easily create reactive GUIs.  
  The initial reason I started scafall, it uses scafall to provide multiplatform GUI APIs.
