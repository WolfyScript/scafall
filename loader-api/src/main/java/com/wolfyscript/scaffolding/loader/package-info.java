/**
 * The loaders task is to load the scaffolding API and internal platform implementation.
 * It itself has no knowledge about the API classes nor the implementation, it is just a plain bootstrap mechanism.
 * It is important to note that this module has no dependencies on external libraries, like kotlin, etc., or if required relocates the dependencies in the final artifact.
